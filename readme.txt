== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What could be the reason if the widget doesn't work? =

The code has been extensively tested and most issues can be resolved by making sure that

1. your server / Wordpress can connect to Twitter
2. your Wordpress upload directory is writable. This is where the widget tries to store the cache file.

Also keep in mind it will only work with public Twitter feeds, not private ones.
